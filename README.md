essbase-parse-export-outline-xml-to-text
========================================

Java code to convert to delimited text file the XML generated by the "export outline" MaxL command

You can use the MaxLExportOutlineParseXML.java file directly or you can launch a form to walk through the process using OutlineReaderGUI.java. The included essbase-parse-export-outline-xml-to-text.jar will launch the GUI. In order for it to work, you need to click on the ZIP button above to download the files in zip format. You can then unzip them and double-click on essbase-parse-export-outline-xml-to-text.jar.

Either way, you'll need to use MaxL as follows to output the outline in XML:
Use the MaxL "export outline" command to export a dimension of the outline
 *   export outline "/path_to_otl/Sample.otl" list dimensions {"Account"} with alias_table "Default" to xml_file "/path_to_save_xml/sample_account_dim.xml";
