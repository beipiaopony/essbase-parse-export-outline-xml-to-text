essbase-parse-export-outline-xml-to-text
========================================

Java code to convert to delimited text file the XML generated by the "export outline" MaxL command

You can use the MaxLExportOutlineParseXML.java file directly or you can launch a form to walk through the process using OutlineReaderGUI.java.

Either way, you'll need to use MaxL as follows to output the outline in XML:
Use the MaxL "export outline" command to export a dimension of the outline
 *   export outline "/path_to_otl/Sample.otl" list dimensions {"Account"} with alias_table "Default" to xml_file "/path_to_save_xml/sample_account_dim.xml";
